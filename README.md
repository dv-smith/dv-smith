# 🛡️ Offensive Security Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my learning journey into **offensive security**. This portfolio serves as a structured record of everything I’ve studied and practiced — from foundational concepts to hands-on labs and real-world scenarios — as I work toward becoming a professional penetration tester.
