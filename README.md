# 🛡️ Offensive Security Portfolio

This repo is where I keep track of everything I'm learning as I get deeper into offensive security — from hands-on labs to scripting, CTFs, and everything in between. I'm building this up as I prepare for certs like the PJPT and work toward landing a real role in pentesting.
